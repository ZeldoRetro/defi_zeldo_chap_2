Here are the different commands
you can do in the game:

- Action (Space) to do context-
sensitive actions (speak, run,
lift, swim, ...).
- Attack (C) to attack with your
sword. By holding the key, 
you will charge your sword. 
You will then have the ability to
tap the walls or do a circular
attack if you release the key.
- Left/right item (X/V) to use
an assigned item in the Inventory
menu.
- Pause (D) to pause the game and
go to the different pause menus.

- Save (Echap) to save your game. 
You will then have the choice to
keep playing or not.
Do not forget that every model
adventurer needs to rest
with regularity !
- Look around (S) to look beyond
the limits of the camera 
by moving it.

The Inventory
If you press the Pause key,

The blue rectangle shows you the

Item left/right key.

The yellow rectangle shows you the
quest items. They show your
progression in several quests,
main quests or side quests.


The green rectangle shows you
the equipment items. These are
the items with a passive effect,
or who give you a new ability.


Finally the red rectangle shows
you some statistics who are
relative to your current game:
Your playtime, your Power/Defense
and your deaths counter.

you will open other menus.
The Map menu will show you the
world map and your current

The detail of the commands can

We are not going to repeat them
here but indicate you that you
can modify them.
To do that, press the Action key
on the command you wish to modify
then press on the new key to use.
Good news for gamepad lovers: 
you can play this game with
a joypad !
To associate a command to a
specific joypad key, the
procedure is the same than before.
However, all your modifications
of keys are saved in your 
current savefile only.
If you start a new game, you will
need to customize your keys

To give a trade item, speak to the

Chapter 7: The day/night cycle

In the world, the Time lapses
only in the outside world.

If you stay in the same area,
you'll hear a sound effect
after a while.
This will mean that the Time
has passed in the next cycle.

When you will quit the area,
the Time will be completely
in the next cycle.
The Time is divided in 6 cycles:
2 for the day, 1 for the twilight,
2 for the night, 1 for the dawn.
We advice you to examine the
world during the day and the
night, especially the villages.
Some events can happen only
during the day or the night.

Additional note: If you sleep,
the Time will go immediately
to the next day or night cycle.
